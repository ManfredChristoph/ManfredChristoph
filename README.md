# About Me
<div>
  <p>
    I am a compassionate and visionary individual driven by empathy, imagination, and purpose. My journey began in biomedical science, evolved through managing hospital construction projects, and now finds expression in backend software engineering. I see technology as a bridge to close the gaps in Africa’s healthcare, agricultural, and fintech infrastructures.
  </p>
  <p>
    Guided by intention, I seek wisdom, growth, and excellence—creating systems that heal, empower, and leave a lasting impact on society. I build not just with code, but with care, creativity, and a commitment to serve.
